>
> ---
>
> #### **4. AI / ML Models**
>
> * Implement **machine learning models** for:
>
>   * AQI risk classification (Good / Moderate / Poor / Severe)
>   * Short-term AQI prediction (next 24–72 hours)
>
> Suggested models:
>
> * Random Forest
> * XGBoost
> * LSTM (for time-series forecasting)
>
> Include:
>
> * Model training
> * Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, accuracy)
> * Feature importance visualization
>
> ---
>
> #### **5. Intelligent Recommendation Engine (VERY IMPORTANT)**
>
> Build a **rule-based + AI-driven recommendation system** that:
>
> * Suggests **health precautions** based on AQI level
> * Recommends **best time to go outside**
> * Gives **city-level actions**:
>
>   * Traffic control suggestions
>   * Industrial emission warnings
>   * Festival/firecracker alerts
>
> Examples:
>
> * “Avoid outdoor activity between 2 PM – 6 PM”
> * “High stagnation detected: pollution may accumulate”
> * “Rain expected tomorrow → AQI likely to improve”
>
> ---
>
> #### **6. Advanced & Unique Features (Must Implement Some)**
>
> * Geo-based AQI Heatmap (Folium / Mapbox)
> * Pollution anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
> * What-If simulation:
>
>   * “What if wind speed increases?”
>   * “What if rainfall occurs?”
> * Personalized exposure score
> * AQI trend comparison between two locations
> * Alert system (email / dashboard notification)
>
> ---
>
> #### **7. Dashboard & Visualization**
>
> * Build an interactive dashboard using:
>
>   * Streamlit / Flask + Plotly
>
> Dashboard sections:
>
> * Live AQI indicators
> * Day / Week / Month / Year tabs
> * Trend graphs
> * Heatmaps
> * Recommendations panel
>
> ---
>
> #### **8. System Architecture & Code Quality**
>
> * Modular architecture:
>
>   ```
>   /data_ingestion
>   /feature_engineering
>   /models
